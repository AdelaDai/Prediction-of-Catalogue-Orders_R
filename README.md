## Prediction of Catalogue Orders
The dataset `cat_buy.rda` contains data on the response of customers to the mailing of spring catalogues.  The variable `buytabw` is `1` if there is an order from this spring catalogue and `0` if not.  This is the dependent or response variable (literally was there a "response" to or order from the direct mailing).  

This spring catalogue was called a "tabloid" in the industry. The catalogue featured women's clothing and shoes. The independent variables represent information gathered from the internal `house file` of the past order activity of these 20,617 customers who received this catalogue.  

In direct marketing, the predictor variables are typically of the "RFM" type: 1. Recency 2. Frequency and 3. Monetary value. This data set has both information on the volume of past orders as well as the recency of these orders. 

The variables are:
* tabordrs  (total orders from past tabloids)  
* divsords  (total orders of shoes in past)  
* divwords  (total orders of women's clothes in past)  
* spgtabord (total orders from past spring cats)  
* moslsdvs  (mos since last shoe order)  
* moslsdvw  (mos since last women's clothes order)  
* moslstab  (mos since last tabloid order)  
* orders    (total orders)
